Abstract
********

What can we learn about a cat's whisker with a simple laser pointer?  
With a few extra tools to hold things steady, and our brains,
we can measure 
interference fringes and calculate the diameter of the whisker. 

These are the same basic methods and similar tools to what are used on many
scientific instruments at
beamlines of the Advanced Photon Source to characterize the atomic
structure of matter.

This demonstration was inspired by a Danish scientist I met at a
conference in the UK.  At the time, he was working in Japan.
Science is a global community!
He updates a weekly blog [#pauw]_ and has created
some interesting videos (such as this one: [#video]_) that explain
difficult scientific concepts in simple, practical terms.
    

Safety
******

Laser light can be damaging to your eyes.
Do not ever look into a laser, you could permanently damage your vision.

Lasers come with different **class** ratings.
The rating is determined by how powerful is 
the laser (high number : more powerful).
Use a laser that is **class I** or **class II**.
These are low enough power that your eye has a 
chance to blink before permanent damage can occur.
**Do not test this with your eyes.**

.. caution:: Some inexpensive laser pointers
   are **class IIIA** or **class III**.
   It is common to find these in consumer stores
   or as holiday gifts.
   Avoid these since it is too easy to be hurt by them.

The Donor
*********

Here is our whisker donor, a female domestic medium-hair cat
wuth tuxedo markings.  Her name is *Govig* (translation: little cow).
She's almost 7 years old now.

        The Whisker Donor: *Govig*

Collect the fiber (whisker) as it has been given freely by the cat.
Do *NOT* take it from the cat directly.  Your relationship
would be forever altered.

How thick is the whisker?

How can we measure the whisker diameter?

* our fingers
* ruler
* calipers
* make a shadow
* diffraction

The Experiment
**************

The experiment consists of shining a single color (monochromatic)
laser beam onto the fiber and measuring the spacing of the 
diffraction fringes that result from the laser interacting
with the diameter of the fiber.

        Experiment schematic

This schematic and experimental process is similar to what is used at many 
X-ray beamlines of the Advanced Photon Source, as shown in the
next figure.  The 
X-rays are generated by an *insertion device*.  They interact 
with a sample (possibly a *crystal*), generating *reflections*
which are measured by a *detector* and collected by a *computer*
for conversion into a model of the sample structure.

Procedure
=========

Take a stiff piece of cardboard and cut out an opening 
large enough to measure most of the fiber length.  
It may be useful to mark distances 
on the card for reference to actual position along the fiber.
Mount the fiber on the cardboard using tape where the fiber is
as straight and parallel as possible to the long side of the card.

.. sidebar::  Don't bump the setup

   Once you have this experiment assembled, you will realize
   quickly why scientists are picky about people moving around
   their equipment.  It gets bumped out of alignment
   easily.

Mount the card on a stand.  We will use a computer-controlled 
motor so that we can see how the whisker is tapered.
(We'll measure the fiber diameter at several places along its length.)
Since precision alignment is important, we'll also use 
a rigid optical track to hold the light source
and any other tubes or pinholes we may want to use.

white light
-----------

Shine a white (polychromatic) light source on the fiber.
At some distance (10 feet or more), tape a white sheet of paper 
to the wall where the beam is.

Turn off the room lights to make it easier to see the shadow of the fiber.
Measure the width of the fiber's shadow on the paper.

Can you get an idea of the fiber's diameter with this method?

green laser light
-----------------

Replace the white light with a green laser (532 nm wavelength) and 
repeat the previous observation.

        Experiment geometry

=========  ====================================
symbol     meaning
=========  ====================================
:math:`D`  whisker diameter
:math:`L`  wavelength of laser
:math:`s`  average fringe spacing
:math:`W`  distance from whisker to the wall
=========  ====================================

You will observe a pattern of *fringes* (due to the diffraction
of green laser light by the fiber).  Measure the average spacing, 
:math:`s` of these fringes.  (Suggestion: measure the midpoints of
two fringes and divide by how many intervals in between to get
an average spacing.)  Don't start from the direct beam (there's
an additional term in that first interval that will throw off 
your measurements).
To measure the shape of the fiber, 
measure :math:`s` at various points along the length of the fiber.
You can use the computer to move the fiber along its length.

It might be good to use software (Microsoft Excel, Igor Pro, Matlab,
gnuplot, Google Docs, LibreOffice Calc, ...) to record your data and plot it.

red laser light
---------------

* Replace the green laser with a red one.
* What is different this time?

Calculations
============

The fringe spacing, :math:`s`, is *inversely propetional* to 
the fiber diameter.  Ignoring all the intermediate steps
(including assumptions that the diffraction is a Fourier transform
of the actual fiber), the relationship between :math:`s` and fiber diameter,
:math:`D` requires two additional terms, the distance, :math:`W`, 
from the fiber to the screen, and the wavelength of the laser light, :math:`L`.

.. math::  D = L {W \over s}

See how the wavelength, :math:`L`, sets a *scale* for the calculation.
Refer to this table for the wavelength of the laser light.

Discussion
**********

* How did your results vary for the two different lasers?
* What is the diameter of the whisker?
* How does the diameter vary along the whisker's length?
* Did you expect this result?
* Why might whisker have this shape?

The feline whisker reveals a simple structure when it interacts with
a laser light beam.  There are other structures in nature that have similar
interaction.  When the nature of the light beam is changed, the interaction
also changes.  

Consider a tendon fiber.  It's a long fiber that connects muscle with bone.  It's
internal structure is revealed when X-rays are used in an experiment
setup almost identical to ours.  The next figure shows the resulting 
fiber diffraction from a chicken leg (drumstick) tendon.

.. compound::

    .. _fig.tendon-diffraction:

    .. figure:: _static/tendon-diffraction.png
        :alt: fig.tendon-diffraction
        :width: 60%

        X-ray diffraction from chicken leg tendon (negative image: black is more intense)

Here, the alternating pattern of strong and weak diffractions is due to
the crystalline nature of the tendon (we used X-rays to probe the atomic-scale
structure, remember that the wavelength is the probe that sets the 
scale of the measurement).  It is possible to
analyze this pattern of spacings and intensity of the fringes to interpret
additional structural information about the tendon.

Look closely at the central part of this image.  There is a white rectangle
at the center.  That's the shadow of a strong absorber (lead, used as a beam stop)
placed in the direct beam to protect the detector from damage.  The reflections
are much less intense than the direct beam.  Without the beam stop in 
place, either the detector would be damaged or the image would be 
saturated by the intense beam.

Conclusion
**********

With simple tools and scientific principles, 
we can investigate and understand more of 
the world around us.
